1- DNA of superinfection phages binds non-specifically to the R-T complex making it more stable. 
2- Free R protein cristalizes in some way that works as a sink for the later released R proteins from the
	complex R-T, ensuring efficient lysis

REFERENCE 18 1967
- Abstract: with increasing rate of superinfection, the length of lysis delay decreased
- They state that Doerman found the length of the delay of the lysis to be constant and independent of the time
	of superinfection (2). But, Ruteberg and Ruteberg, found that the length of the delay increased when they 	increased the interval between primary and superinfection.
- infection rate: phages adsorbed per minute and per tota phages adsorbed during the entire infection period
- DISCUSSION: The length of lysis delay is primarily determined by the MOSI (multiplicity of Superinfection) and in 	less measure by the time of the first superinfection
	- An increase of the rate of superinfection can reduce the efficiency of superinfection
	- Superinfection reduces the leak of ATP to 0.5 in the latent period. At some point when there is no more 
	ATP the membrane mught desintegrate and let endolysin eat the wall.

- Ulrik makes reference to it to show that the burst size is difficult to predict. 
- Ask for the difference in the two kinds of cells they use. Ulrik does not say they are different. Are they?
